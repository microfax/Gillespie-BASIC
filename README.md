# Gillespie-BASIC

Gillespie Basic for Windows is a spinoff from the original 1990's Chipmunk Basic 1.0 by Dave Gillespie.  The main story behind the original Chipmunk Basic is that Dave Gillespie included it in his P2C (Pascal to C) translator.  That is to say, the original Chipmunk Basic 1.0 was created in Pascal for an old HP system known colloquially as Chipmunk -- hence the name.  

Over the years, several other developers have used the Chipmunk 1.0 source code and porting and modifying it for various platforms, including Apple, Atari, Linux, and others.  I decided naming this software "Gillespie Basic" would pay respect to the original programmer and more easily distinguish this project from the others.

Gillespie Basic is a recreational past time for me that I think other folks will enjoy. Whereas Gillespie Basic retains almost all of the original Chipmunk 1.0 functionality, and fewer bugs, I've spent a number of hours adding more functionality to it. I've also tried to make the "C" source code for it easier to understand and work with.  A lot of the new functionality is borrowed from one of my earlier projects - BCX (The Basic To C Translator). 

I enjoy using Pelles C as my compiler system - certainly other compilers will work with minimal fuss.  But please understand that Gillespie Basic makes many calls to the Win32 API, so porting this source code to other platforms will require more effort.  All that being said, I feel Gillespie Basic strikes a nice blend of cool vintage look and feel while enjoying some benefits of running natively on a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows.  If there is any interest, I will post updates.

My development PC is running Windows 10 Pro 64-bit but I'm compiling for 32-bit.
